Icon 2 Sign is a project I made in a JavaScript 1 class
The goal was to make a page with icons that when clicked show the user a corresponding GIF of the American Sign Language sign for the icon.
I was inspired by PECS boards: wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Exchange_Communication_System which use images for non verbal people to communicate.
I wanted to make something that would allow non verbal people a tool to learn the ASL signs for the items on their PECS board,
or for people who don't read to learn sign language through icons.
